I used the following logic to extract the menu items: 
- For the context "Soda", I included "Coke" and "Diet Coke" as they are both soft drink options.
- The context "Chicken sandwich" is represented by the "BBQ Chicken Sandwich", "Bacon Cheese Burger", and "Cheese Burger" entries, as they involve chicken or are hamburger options often consumed similarly to chicken sandwiches.
- For the context "burrito", I included various burrito options such as "Deluxe Burrito", "Carne Asada Burrito", "Frontera Burrito", "Fajita Burrito", and "Pollo Asado Burrito", as they directly fit the description of burritos.

  "reasoning": "I used the following logic to extract the menu items: The context includes 'biryani' and 'samosas'. For 'biryani', I identified two menu items: 'Chicken Biryani' and 'Goat Biryani', which match the term directly since they are both types of biryani. For 'samosas', I included two items: 'Samosa Chaat' and 'Samosa', both of which directly mention samosas and thus meet the context requirement. Therefore, I returned a list of these items as they are directly relevant to the user's interests."
