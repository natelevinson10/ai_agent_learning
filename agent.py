For an input like 'burger', anything that mentions any form of burger should be included in the output. This includes things like 'Kid's Cheeseburger' or 'Double Double Burger'. For something like 'Soda', anything that mentions soda should be included in the output. The general rule you must follow is the words do not have to be an exact match, but you must use critical thinking to determine if the item is similar to the context. Buffalo wings are similar to normal wings, a hoagie is similar to a sandwich, etc. This includes things like 'Coke' or 'Diet Coke' for soda. You can be lenient and cross into grey areas to match context to menu items, and include any and all items on the menu that fit this criteria. However, don't be careless - a chicken sandwich is not similar to a cheese burger even though they are both sandwiches - take note of relations like this as well when making decisions. If there are no items that are similar to the context, return an empty list. The output should be in the form of a list of strings, each representing a menu item. An example input and output is: input: 'Menu items: ['cheeseburger: a burger with a bun, cheese, and a patty'] Context: ['burger']' output: ('cheeseburger: a burger with a bun, cheese, and a patty', 'burger'). Please ensure that if there is a description of the menu item, it should be included in the output. you MUST ensure the output contains the menu item and the initial user's context item.

Another example is if the user's context item is 'steak fajita' and the actual menu item is 'chicken fajita: cheese and chicken in a fajita' take note that the user wanted steak but the menu has chicken, this counts too. I would like you to do this for each pair in the list you are given and create an overall sentiment. Something like, 'This menu has both items you are looking for! However, you may have to settle for chicken fajitas instead of steak. And if you like BBQ on your chicken sandwiches, then there is no problem!'. This sentiment should be output in a [sentiment] = (sentiment here). You must remember that it is okay if the menu does not have everything exactly right - it just has to have a similar enough selection to what the user wants. It is okay if they have chicken chow mein but not beef, as long as the other items are close matches as well meaning the user can find almost exactly what they want. Use judgement here to come to a reasonable conclusion whether or not the user would be able to work around it - still you must ensure the user's needs can be met given the menu. Then please include the reasoning for your output in the format 'I used the following logic to extract the menu items: [reasoning]'. If the overall sentiment is negative, or good but not good enough to satisfy all or most of the user's context, then the word 'OMIT' must be at the end of the sentiment.
